                        <p>
                            Our identity is found in Christ alone. We believe that through His sacrifice, we are made new
                             and called to live as His children. Embracing our identity in Christ means understanding and 
                             accepting that we are loved, redeemed, and called to a purpose greater than ourselves.
                             This foundational truth shapes our lives, guiding our actions, decisions, and interactions with others.

                            At First Century Gospel, we see the church as a family where everyone belongs. We strive to create 
                            an atmosphere of love, acceptance, and support, where relationships are nurtured and each person
                             is valued. Our community is built on mutual respect and care, reflecting the unity and fellowship
                              that God desires for His people.
                             Together, we share in joys, bear burdens, and grow in faith, ensuring no one walks alone.

                            We believe in living a Spirit-led life, guided by the Holy Spirit in all we do. This
                             means being open to His leading, listening for His voice, and allowing Him to work
                              through us to accomplish God's purposes. By relying on the Holy Spirit, we are empowered 
                              to live out our faith boldly, to serve others selflessly, and to navigate life's challenges
                               with wisdom and grace.
                             Our dependence on the Spirit brings renewal, strength, and direction to our everyday lives.

                             all matters of faith and practice. Our faith is rooted in the belief in the Holy Trinity- God
                              the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We believe in the power of prayer, the 
                              importance of fellowship, and the necessity of spreading the Gospel to all corners of the earth.
                               Our mission is to love God,

                            At First Century Gospel Church, our core beliefs are grounded in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Holy Scriptures.

                             presence of the Holy Spirit. We believe that salvation is a gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus
                              Christ, and that the Bible is the ultimate authority for Christian living. Our community is committed
                               to worship, discipleship, and evangelism, striving to reflect God's love through our words and actions.
